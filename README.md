The primary objective of the Instant News Bot is to create a seamless and personalized news
delivery experience. The user engagement process begins with the bot prompting the user for input,
specifically asking for their preferred news topic and email address.
 This interactive model not only enhances user engagement but also tailors the news delivery
process to individual interests.
 Upon receiving the user's input, the Instant News Bot leverages the capabilities of UiPath
RPA to autonomously navigate to Google.com, the ubiquitous source of real-time information. It
dynamically searches for the latest news related to the specified topic, utilizing advanced web
scraping techniques to ensure the extraction of relevant and up-to-date information.
 The culmination of this process is the delivery of a personalized news package directly to
the user's mailbox.
